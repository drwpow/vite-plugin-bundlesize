# 0.3.0

## Minor changes

- 🆕 Thanks [@matt-greenfield-15](https://github.com/matt-greenfield-15)! Allows measuring across all chunks, not just the entry.
- ⚠️ Minor breaking change: now **all chunks** have size limits enforced. You can specify `entryPointOnly: true` to opt back into previous behavior.
- ⚠️ Minor breaking change: minimum Vite version raised to 6.x.
- Dependencies updated, tested and working with Vite 7.x.
