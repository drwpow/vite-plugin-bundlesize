# vite-plugin-bundlesize example

With [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) installed:

```
pnpm i
npm run dev:viz
```

You’ll then see a bundlesize visualier appear at `localhost:5888`.

⚠️ **This app has some intentional code problems!** It will also **fail** its bundlesize check. So keep in mind that this shows the reason why you’d use a bundle analyzer; not how you should structure your application.

_As an exercise, can you find all the ways to improve this app?_
